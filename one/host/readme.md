# One Host Library

The Host is the component that must be integrated into game servers.

It provides an API surface for the game server to use to listen for an Agent connection and send and receive messages to and from the game server.

It interally uses and depends on the arcus library.

This library, along with the arcus library, must be integrated into the game server build.
