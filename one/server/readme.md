# One Server Library

The Server is the component that must be integrated into the game.

It provides an API surface to listen for an incoming connection from the One platform, servicing the connection, and supplies methods to listen to and send One messages.

It interally uses and depends on the arcus library.

This library, along with the arcus library, must be integrated into the game server build.
