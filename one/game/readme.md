# Fake Game

A fake game that integrates and uses the One Game Hosting server. The code here can be used both as a reference for how real game servers can integrate and use the server library, or as a way to test the library for correctness.

It is *not* intended to be included in the game server's build nor is it required to build the server or accompanying arcus folder libraries.
